# Moving Object Detection with OpenCV

## Overview
This project aims to develop a robust system for detecting and tracking moving objects in video streams using OpenCV, an open-source computer vision library. The system is designed to work in real-time or with recorded footage, providing accurate identification and tracking of moving objects under various environmental conditions.

## Problem Statement
Detecting and tracking moving objects in video streams is a crucial task in computer vision with significant applications in surveillance, autonomous navigation, and human-computer interaction. Traditional methods have relied on frame differencing and background subtraction, but more advanced techniques are necessary to handle diverse scenarios effectively. This project addresses this challenge by leveraging OpenCV for efficient and accurate object detection and tracking.

## Proposed Solution
The solution involves:
- Utilizing OpenCV to detect moving objects from a static camera position.
- Implementing classical computer vision techniques like background subtraction and contour detection.
- Avoiding the use of deep learning to keep the system simple and effective.
